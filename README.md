## üìå Project Report

### üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze customer purchase behavior, sales trends, and product performance for a coffee shop chain using SQL. The dataset includes sales transactions, customer demographics, and product details. The goal is to answer key business questions, derive insights, and support decision-making with data-driven evidence.

### üí° Recommendations

* Run targeted promotions for low-selling SKUs
Create small discounts, bundle combos (e.g., Coffee-Themed Notebook + Coffee Mug), or include the low-selling merchandise as an add-on with drinks to increase visibility and sales.

* Fix data anomalies
Investigate months with suspiciously low totals in 2024 (e.g., Oct 2024, Jul 2024).

* Short-term marketing in underperforming cities
Run low-cost digital ads, local promotions, or delivery discounts in Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad to increase customer acquisition. Consider LTOs (limited-time offers) for these cities and measure new-customer signups.

* Inventory & SKU rationalization
Move slow-moving merchandise (e.g., Notebook, Spoon, Recipe Book) to ‚Äúdiscount shelf‚Äù or reduce reorder frequency. Test whether restyling/packaging or price change helps before delisting.

* Leverage high-value markets
For Pune (high avg spend), introduce premium offerings (seasonal specialty drinks, premium bundles), loyalty tiers, and subscription/coffee-club models to increase lifetime value.

* Peak-season readiness
Prepare for Oct‚ÄìDec demand: staff scheduling, stock buffers for best-selling products, and marketing calendar. For the next peak season, pre-plan campaigns 6‚Äì8 weeks in advance.

* City expansion & replication
Analyze what works in Pune, Chennai, Bangalore (menu mix, pricing, promotions) and pilot those strategies in lower-performing but high-potential markets (Nagpur, Lucknow, Indore).

* Customer retention & loyalty
Launch a loyalty program to convert repeat buyers into high-LTV customers; offer targeted promotions to customers who recently purchased premium items.

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

* The dataset shows clear winners (cities like Pune, Chennai, Bangalore and late-year seasonality) and clear opportunities (underperforming products and several cities with low customer counts).
* Short-term focus: fix 2024 data anomalies, run promotions for low-selling SKUs, and target low-customer cities with acquisition offers.
* Medium-term focus: optimize inventory, launch a loyalty program for high-LTV customers, and scale successful strategies from top cities to others.
